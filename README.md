# 🦉 SkillSage – Smarter Skills in Shorter Time

A **Streamlit-based web application** that simulates a real-world **coaching and learning platform**. Students can book sessions with expert coaches,
 while coaches can manage sessions and track earnings.

This project is built as part of the **$10 Challenge (Week 3)**, focusing on applying **Python OOP principles** in a simulated business application.
